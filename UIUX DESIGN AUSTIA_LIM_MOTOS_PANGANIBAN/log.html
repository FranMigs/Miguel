    <h1> Web Development</h1>
    <h2>
        Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also include web design, web programming, and database management.
        Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of apps (web design). The term development is usually reserved for the actual construction of these things (that is to say, the programming of sites).

    <h2> The Beginner's Guide to Website Development</h2>

    <h2>Why is web development important?</h2>
    <p>
        The Internet isn’t going anywhere. In fact, it’s become a portal and primary method of research, connection, education, and entertainment in the world. As of 2021, there were 4.66 billion global Internet users — more than half the world’s population.
        
        Given the rapidly-increasing number of Internet users, it’s no surprise that web development is a rapidly expanding industry. Between now and 2030, the employment of web developers is expected to grow by 13%, much faster than most other technology careers.
        
        See why thousands of customers use CMS Hub to build an optimized website that integrates with their HubSpot CRM data and full marketing suite.
        
        In the next sections, we’ll cover the differences between web development and programming, the basics of web development, and the answers to some common questions.
        
        Web Development vs. Web Programming
        Web development and web programming sound very similar — and they are. But there’s one very important distinction. 
        
        Web development refers to the overall process of creating websites or web applications, including the project’s design, layout, coding, content creation, and functionality. It involves using a combination of programming languages, tools, and frameworks to bring a website or web application to life. It may also encompass project management activities, such as fielding development requests from stakeholders or freelance clients. 
        
        Web programming, on the other hand, specifically refers to the coding and scripting of a website, whether the front-end or back-end. It primarily involves writing code to handle data, process user inputs, and generate dynamic content. A web programmer will rarely, if ever, handle a web development project from end-to-end. They may build a certain section of a site or troubleshoot bugs.
        
        In general, web development encompasses a broader scope. Web developers need to have a holistic understanding of web design, usability, accessibility, as well as coding and programming skills.</p>
